# In this page I will show you how to use markdown

## Markdown is a lightweight markup language

You can use markdown to write blogs, readme files, etc.
This website is also written in markdown.

## **Bold** and *Italic* and their ***combinations***


## Markdown also supports code blocks

```python
for i in range(10):
    print("Hello World")
```
We can also use inline code like `print("Hello World")`

>Create a block quote

## Insert code blocks with tab
    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>
